### üñ• Project Overview
A cyber-themed portfolio website developed to showcase my professional experiences, playful projects, and personal interests (information not updated since 2022). Built using React and powered by components from the [Arwes UI Framework](https://github.com/arwes/arwes), the site features interactive sound effects, animations, and a futuristic cyberpunk design.

### üõ† Key Components

#### ‚öôÔ∏è `App.js`
The central component of the application, `App.js`, orchestrates the layout, themes, sounds, and user interface interactions across the portfolio.

- **Imports**:
  - Utilizes [Arwes](https://github.com/arwes/arwes), a futuristic design framework that provides cyber-themed components and animations. Most UI elements are sourced from this framework, including `ThemeProvider`, `SoundsProvider`, `Button`, `Frame`, `Highlight`, `Header`, and `Footer`.
  - Imports sound effects (`click`, `deploy`, `typing`) and background images to create an engaging visual and auditory experience.
  - Includes primary components like `Profile`, `InfoFrame`, and navigation buttons for LinkedIn and Contact.

- **Theme and Sound Configurations**:
  - **Custom Theme**: Defines a cyberpunk color palette with neon greens, blues, and bright accents.
  - **Sounds**: Configures sound effects that trigger with user interactions, enhancing the immersive experience.

- **Sections**:
  - **HighlightNav**: An animated navigation menu allowing users to switch between "Experience," "Play," and "Ideas" sections.
  - **InfoFrame**: Displays content based on the selected section, with smooth transitions.

- **Main Layout**:
  - Leverages the `Arwes` framework's `ThemeProvider`, `SoundsProvider`, and layout components to create a cohesive cyber look and feel.
  - **Header and Footer**: Includes site title, social media links, and a "Back to top" button for easy navigation.
